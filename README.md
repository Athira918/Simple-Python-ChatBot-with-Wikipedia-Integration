# Simple-Python-ChatBot-with-Wikipedia-Integration
This project is a simple yet engaging chatbot developed using Python and natural language processing techniques. It is designed to simulate basic human conversation by responding to greetings, questions, farewells, and common small talk phrases. The chatbot relies on predefined patterns, keyword matching, and a lightweight conversational structure that makes it ideal for beginner-friendly environments or demonstration purposes.

The chatbot begins by recognizing various user intents such as greetings, farewells, expressions of gratitude, and basic questions. It uses a predefined dictionary of phrases and corresponding responses, enabling it to reply conversationally to user inputs like “hello,” “thank you,” or “what’s your name?” Additionally, the chatbot handles small talk with witty or friendly responses that add a human-like touch to the interaction.

A key feature of the project is its integration with the Wikipedia API. When a user inputs a query that isn't part of the predefined structure, the chatbot attempts to fetch a relevant summary from Wikipedia, thereby making it capable of handling general knowledge questions. This expands the chatbot’s functionality and makes it more interactive and informative.

The project also demonstrates the use of NLP tools such as NLTK for preprocessing user inputs. Stemming and tokenization are applied to help the chatbot better understand variations in user queries. The entire interaction loop is structured to run continuously, allowing real-time conversations in a terminal-based interface.

Overall, this chatbot project blends rule-based logic with real-world knowledge retrieval, offering a compact, educational example of how chatbots can be built from scratch using Python. It's ideal for students, hobbyists, or anyone curious about building intelligent conversation agents.
